Comparator takes in two images on file, and returns a similarity metric between them.

## Build and Run Instructions (local)

Assumes you have the rust toolchain installed - this will take a bit of time on the first run.

```
$ cargo run
```

### Tests

A good way to verify that everything works.

```
$ cargo test
```

## Build and Run Instructions (Docker)

Coming soon!
